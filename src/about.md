I'm a Software Developer specializing in web-based video players with a focus on accessibility and subtitles.

I'm a Chair of the [Timed Text Working Group](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/) and an editor of the [WebVTT specification](https://github.com/w3c/webvtt).

In my spare time, I read books and manga; watch movies, TV, and anime; and cook.
